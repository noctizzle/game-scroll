# Game review

## 2026-11-11: whole-catalogue review (244 games)

Every game file was checked again: the code or its design notes, a mid-play screenshot, the idle and random-tap bots (`npm run qa`), a 20-second no-touch run and the goal-reaching bot (`scripts/playtest.cjs`). These are Claude's judgement, not player data; Rob's in-app ratings (👎 Meh / ♥) overrule them. Nothing has been deleted: removal waits for Rob.

- **Keep:** 221 games (121 of them changed in this pass, see below).
- **Recommended for removal:** 9 (eight weak games and one duplicate).
- **Too close to one existing game:** 13. Good games, but each follows one well-known game's rules and look closely enough to break the "original, not a recreation" rule. Drop or re-theme.
- **Hidden already:** ar-lab (the AR test scene, on the BENCHED list).

### Recommended for removal (9)

| Game | Why |
|---|---|
| Colour Hunt (`color-hunt`) | Needs the camera and a walk round the room, and a matching colour is easy to fake or impossible to find. The no-camera version is a different, weaker game. |
| Shake Dice (`shake-dice`) | Dice luck against "the house" with one choice (roll or bank). Shake Tree does push-your-luck better and without the casino feel. |
| Shake Soda (`shake-soda`) | One four-second gag: shake, then wait. Nothing to learn on a second go. |
| Swipe the Arrow (`swipe-arrow`) | A bare reflex test. Random swipes end a round in half a second, and several other games use swipes with more to them. |
| Tap on Green (`tap-green`) | A reaction-time test rather than a game. Thumb Duel is the same idea with fake-outs, a rival and two-player. |
| Bubble Level (`bubble-level`) | The thinnest of the tilt games (Tilt Maze, Steady Hand, Marble Trio all do more), and it scored with no touch. |
| Compass Hunt (`compass-hunt`) | You have to turn your whole body. Awkward on a sofa or a bus, and with no compass it is just dragging a dot to the middle. |
| Lane Racer (`lane-racer`) | The most basic game in the app (2.7 KB): four lanes, dodge. Road Hopper, Ski Slalom, Kit Racer and Pocket Kart cover it. |
| Lamp Flip (`lamp-flip`) | Same lights-out puzzle as Street Lamps, which has the daily shared-with-your-neighbourhood twist. Keep one. |

On the 2026-11-06 shortlist but kept now: higher-lower, shout-rocket, safe-cracker, haptic-morse (Buzz Code) and penalty-keeper. Each was fixed or turned out to work without the sensor it leans on.

### Too close to one existing game (13)

The rule (AGENTS.md): genres and mechanics are fine; recreating a specific existing game (its characters, rules or look, even renamed) is not. Each of these has its own art and names, but the set of rules taken together points at one game. They were left unedited so the choice stays open, except blob-pairs and panel-rise, which got the same engine updates as everything else.

| Game | Too close to | What gives it away |
|---|---|---|
| Copy Puff (`copy-puff`) | the pink puff platformers | A round puff that floats by flapping, sucks in enemies and copies their power (spark, blade, rock). |
| Garden Guard (`garden-guard`) | the lawn defence game with plants | Collect falling dew, pick seed cards, plant in lanes: a resource flower, a pea shooter, a wall and a bomb against a marching column, with the house on the left. |
| Crate Dash (`crate-dash`) | the orange marsupial crate platformers | Run into the screen down a jungle path, spin through wooden crates, red explosive crates, bouncy crates, 100 gems for a life. |
| Cube Tide (`cube-tide`) | the 1997 rolling-cube puzzle game | Cubes roll down a floating floor, you mark a tile and trigger it to sink them, green cubes leave a 3x3 trap, never sink a black one, lost cubes shorten the floor. |
| Saber Knight (`saber-knight`) | the space-knight film series | A robed knight with a glowing blade knocking blaster bolts back and a "push" power. |
| Grid Duel (`grid-duel`) | the net-battler handheld RPG series | A 6x3 grid split blue and red, a buster down your row, battle chips (sword, cannon, bomb, wide slash) loading into a tray. |
| Timing Brawl (`timing-brawl`) | the paper plumber RPG battles | Turn-based fights with JUMP (tap on landing) and BASH/hammer (hold and release), spiky foes you cannot jump on, flying foes you cannot bash. |
| Suit Ops (`suit-ops`) | the nanosuit shooter | A power suit with ARMOR, CLOAK, SPEED and POWER modes on one energy bar, on a jungle island. |
| Egg Catcher (`egg-catcher`) | the 1981 LCD egg handheld | Four hens, four ramps, a catcher moved between four corners, three broken eggs. The file itself says it is "a classic LCD handheld idea". |
| Germ Buster (`germ-buster`) | the capsule-and-virus puzzle game | Two-tone capsules dropped onto germs in a bottle, four in a line clears. |
| Blob Pairs (`blob-pairs`) | the falling-blob-pairs puzzle series | Pairs of blobs, four touching pop, chains, grey junk blobs that clear when a pop touches them. |
| Panel Rise (`panel-rise`) | the rising-panel swap puzzle series | A rising stack, swap two side by side, clears of three, chain bonuses. |
| Mansion Night (`mansion-night`) | the mansion survival-horror series | A dark mansion, a six-shot pistol, green herbs to heal, a knife when out of ammo, head shots. Also the grimmest game in a family app. |

Genre-level only, fine to keep: shell-duel (turn-based artillery), sling-smash (slingshot physics), critter-quest (monster-collecting RPG), stud-smash, pile-builder and the other brick games (toy bricks), gap-drop (rotating floors), bricks (brick breaker), blob-ball, pocket-kart, bunker-breakout (corridor shooter), pin-pull. sword-rooms had a green cap and tunic on its hero; it is now blue.

### Changes made in this pass (123 games)

- **Shared effects (100 older games).** Games written before `gs.effects.Feel` each had their own particle list, or none. They now use Feel for bursts, pop-up numbers and shake (with the game's own sounds kept), so hits, clears and losses look and feel the same everywhere, follow the player's Reduce motion setting, and finish playing behind the game-over screen (`fx(dt)`).
- **Wait for the first touch (60 games).** `gs.rounds.Ready`: nothing moves, scores or ends until the player touches the screen. Before this pass 17 games ended by themselves within six seconds of Play and 25 scored points with no touch. In a 20-second no-touch run of every game now, the only keepers that still end or score are ones where that is the design: races that start on a countdown (gravity-grip, neon-drift), bunker-breakout (auto-fire), freeze-rex (holding still is the game) and two puzzles whose timer is about 20 seconds (hand-sort, spinner-keep).
- **Score badge.** fossil-dig, hop-quest, rex-rampage, star-bloom and hoop-drone size or place their HUD from `api.scoreArea()`; fast-maths and mole-mallet moved their lives out from under the badge.
- **Game time, not the wall clock.** blitz-bits, blob-ball, blob-pairs, fossil-dig, deep-pressure and street-lamps used `performance.now()` or `setTimeout` for game timing, which keeps running while the game is paused. They use `dt` now. (Tap-versus-hold timing in the 3D games and the daily clock in treasure-drop are real time on purpose and were left.)
- **Same speed on 60 and 120 Hz screens.** Per-frame damping (`v *= .98`) became `Math.pow(.98, dt * 60)` in blitz-sense, blow-sail, fly-swatter, gravity-grip, pet-pocket, shell-duel, stud-smash, stylus-rally and wrecking-ball; camera easing in canyon-ace, deep-pressure, frost-line and storm-hook.
- **Goals the bot reached in seconds.** dart-wheel 25 to 60, merge-ten 150 to 500, mini-golf 12 to 25, moto-hills 120 to 350, rope-swing 200 to 1000, freeze-rex 500 to 1200 (plus a 1.5 s wind-on between photos).
- **Bugs.** bricks: the ball could speed up without limit off the paddle. street-lamps: a failed location request could leave it waiting for ever. pocket-pinball: each finger now works its own flipper. fishing-line: a smooth gradient broke the four-shade Pocket rule. critter-quest: the battle strobe follows Reduce motion. spot-difference: the pictures stay covered until you start, so the clock is fair. Several games kept a little state from the last round (held keys, a drag in progress); all round state is set in `reset()` now.

## First review: scores (2026-11-06)

Every game scored 1-5 on five things, out of 25. Scored on 2026-11-06 from the code, a mid-play screenshot and the bot play test in [auto-report.md](auto-report.md). These are Claude's judgement, not player data. Rob's in-app ratings (👎 Meh / ♥, see the QA panel) should overrule them.

- **Fun**: is it enjoyable for a few rounds?
- **Clarity**: can you play it from the one-line hint?
- **Controls**: do touch controls feel right, and does it work without special sensors?
- **Length**: does a round last a good feed-sized time (about 20s to 2 min)?
- **Uniqueness**: is it unlike the other games in the app?

Sorted weakest first. Marks are as of 2026-11-11: ✂ = recommended for removal, ⚠ = too close to one existing game.

| # | Game | Fun | Clarity | Controls | Length | Unique | Total | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | ✂ bubble-level | 2 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | **13** | Third tilt-the-marble game next to Tilt Maze and Steady Hand, and the weakest. |
| 2 | ✂ shake-soda | 2 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 3 | **13** | Shake then wait. Thin, and similar to Water Rocket's build-to-the-limit. |
| 3 | ✂ color-hunt | 2 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 5 | **14** | Needs the camera and walking round the room. Breaks the scroll rhythm. |
| 4 | ✂ compass-hunt | 2 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 4 | **14** | You have to turn your whole body. Awkward on a sofa or bus, and does nothing without a compass. |
| 5 | safe-cracker | 2 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 4 | **14** | Off the shortlist: the right number also glows on the dial, so it plays without haptics. |
| 6 | ✂ shake-dice | 2 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 2 | **14** | Pig dice with a shake. Little choice, and a dupe of Balloon Pump's push-your-luck. |
| 7 | shout-rocket | 2 | 4 | 2 | 3 | 3 | **14** | Off the shortlist after this pass: waits for your first shout or hold. Still the weakest mic game. |
| 8 | ✂ swipe-arrow | 2 | 4 | 4 | 2 | 2 | **14** | Generic hypercasual reflex test with little to learn. |
| 9 | penalty-keeper | 2 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 3 | **15** | Reworked 2026-11-06 at Rob's request; now waits for your first touch. |
| 10 | blow-candles | 3 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 4 | **16** | Fun once, but needs the mic and runs short. |
| 11 | clap-beat | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 4 | **16** | Mic clapping is novel but unreliable in noisy rooms; tap fallback is fine. |
| 12 | haptic-morse | 2 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 4 | **16** | Off the shortlist: flashes the screen where the phone cannot buzz. |
| 13 | higher-lower | 2 | 4 | 5 | 3 | 2 | **16** | Off the shortlist after this pass (shared effects, clearer feedback). Still the weakest push-your-luck game. |
| 14 | hoop-flick | 3 | 4 | 4 | 2 | 3 | **16** | One miss ends it; short sessions. |
| 15 | jelly-bounce | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 4 | **16** | Timing window is hard to read. |
| 16 | magnet-pull | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 4 | **16** | Floaty; looks sparse on screen. |
| 17 | space-dock | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 4 | **16** | Inverted thrust is confusing, but some will love it. |
| 18 | steady-hand | 3 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | **16** | Tilt balance; overlaps Tilt Maze. |
| 19 | ✂ tap-green | 2 | 5 | 5 | 2 | 2 | **16** | A reaction-time test, not really a game. |
| 20 | tilt-maze | 3 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | **16** | Fine tilt maze with drag fallback. |
| 21 | water-rocket | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 4 | **16** | Two-phase game; pressure step drags. |
| 22 | domino-chain | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 5 | **17** | Clever, but the draw-a-path rule takes a couple of tries to understand. |
| 23 | hide-peek | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 5 | **17** | Face-down phone trick is unique but confusing at first. |
| 24 | ✂ lane-racer | 2 | 5 | 5 | 3 | 2 | **17** | Very basic four-lane dodge. Road Hopper and Ski Slalom do this better. |
| 25 | mine-cart | 3 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 4 | **17** | Switch rule takes a moment; the first few seconds are risk-free. |
| 26 | quiet-ninja | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 5 | **17** | Original idea; the mic makes it unfair in a noisy room. |
| 27 | rock-blaster | 3 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3 | **17** | OK; overlaps with Sky Defense. |
| 28 | rope-swing | 3 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3 | **17** | Mashing works too well; looks sparse. |
| 29 | spring-jumper | 3 | 4 | 4 | 2 | 4 | **17** | Rounds are short and the gap read is hard. |
| 30 | tilt-pour | 3 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 4 | **17** | Cute pouring; tilt is fiddly. |
| 31 | bottle-flip | 3 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 4 | **18** | Satisfying flick, thin over time. |
| 32 | code-breaker | 3 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 3 | **18** | Good logic puzzle but slow for a scroll feed. |
| 33 | colour-flood | 3 | 4 | 5 | 3 | 3 | **18** | Fine, quiet puzzle. |
| 34 | colour-word | 3 | 4 | 5 | 2 | 4 | **18** | Sharp brain teaser, but one wrong tap ends it in seconds. |
| 35 | ⚠ egg-catcher | 3 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 3 | **18** | Handheld classic, simple and fair. Too close to one existing game: see the 2026-11-11 list. |
| 36 | fast-maths | 3 | 5 | 5 | 2 | 3 | **18** | Quick and clear. Fine as feed filler. |
| 37 | ⚠ germ-buster | 4 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 3 | **18** | Falling-capsule puzzle; swipe controls take a minute. Too close to one existing game: see the 2026-11-11 list. |
| 38 | lemonade-stand | 3 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 4 | **18** | Light strategy; good change of pace. |
| 39 | mirror-beam | 3 | 4 | 5 | 3 | 3 | **18** | Fine; overlaps a little with Pipe Plumber. |
| 40 | moto-hills | 4 | 3 | 3 | 4 | 4 | **18** | Good, but lean-in-air is hard to learn. |
| 41 | rock-paper | 3 | 3 | 5 | 3 | 4 | **18** | Clever pattern-reading, but slow to click. |
| 42 | skate-ollie | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 4 | **18** | Tricks are fun; first obstacle comes quickly. |
| 43 | ski-slalom | 4 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3 | **18** | Good. |
| 44 | street-lamps | 3 | 4 | 5 | 3 | 3 | **18** | Lights-out puzzle. The GPS twist is invisible to the player. |
| 45 | tile-tap | 3 | 5 | 5 | 2 | 3 | **18** | Piano-tiles style; short rounds. |
| 46 | balloon-pump | 4 | 4 | 5 | 3 | 3 | **19** | Best of the three push-your-luck games. Keep this one. |
| 47 | balloon-rise | 4 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 4 | **19** | Good shove-the-blocks physics. |
| 48 | bomb-maze | 4 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 4 | **19** | Solid bomb maze; drag-to-walk is a bit fiddly. |
| 49 | bomb-sweeper | 4 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 4 | **19** | Classic logic. Random taps die fast, as they should. |
| 50 | bubble-pop | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 3 | **19** | Bubble shooter done well. |
| 51 | candy-swing | 4 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 4 | **19** | Rope-cut physics puzzle; good when the cut lands. |
| 52 | crate-pusher | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 3 | **19** | Box-push puzzle, good rooms. |

## Batches 13-17 (41 games), reviewed 2026-11-07

Same scoring. Most of these are deeper "handheld era" games (RPGs, tactics, farming, racing), so they score lower on Length for a scroll feed and higher on Uniqueness. None crashed in the bot test. The weakest are listed first.

| # | Game | Fun | Clarity | Controls | Length | Unique | Total | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | blitz-sense | 3 | 3 | 2 | 4 | 4 | **16** | Fun idea, but half the micro games need the mic, tilt or shake, which a lot of players can't use on a bus. |
| 2 | fossil-dig | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 4 | **16** | Rub-to-brush is calm but slow; the brush/pick difference takes a try to learn. |
| 3 | ⚠ cube-tide | 3 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 4 | **15** | Three trap rules (grey, green, black) at once is a lot to read from the hint. Too close to one existing game: see the 2026-11-11 list. |

## Changes made in the 2026-11-07 pass

**Console look.** Console games used to render as chunky pixels like the Pocket games. They now draw at full phone resolution, with a shared lighting pass (warm key light and vignette), and every console game was redrawn with soft shadows, gradients, glossy spheres and glows from the new `src/kit/gfx.js`. The brick kit is now glossy plastic with lit studs.

**Balance.**
- **colour-word, fast-maths, hoop-flick:** three hearts instead of one mistake ending the round. All three were flagged for very short rounds.
- **cave:** hovers until your first touch, instead of crashing in under a second if you don't react.
- **tile-tap:** tiles wait for your first tap, like the genre.
- **rope-swing:** you start hanging from the first hook, instead of falling unless you grab within a second.
- **spring-jumper:** a dotted arc shows where you'll land while you charge, and early gaps are smaller.
- **jelly-bounce:** the timing windows are wider. A tap just before landing now counts as GOOD; it used to be silently thrown away.
